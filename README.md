# SQL-_queries_Michigan_Medicine
This repository contains SQL files and Python files to make queries or download large data sets from the Oracle database named Roadmap at Michigan Medicine. These are various example queries I made to understand the wearable data set in the table Roadmap at Michigan Medicine. I used the downloaded data from Roadmap to do several statistical and machine-learning analyses.
