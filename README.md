# SQL-_queries_Michigan_Medicine
This repository contains SQL files and Python files to make queries or download large data sets from the Oracle database named Roadmap at Michigan Medicine. I wrote these various example queries to understand the wearable data set in the Roadmap Oracle database at Michigan Medicine. I wrote included Python code to download these large data sets, or various other information from the Oracle database. I am using the downloaded data from Roadmap to do several statistical and machine-learning analyses. I mainly worked on two data sets from Roadmap.
1. Measurements from wearable devices on Bone Marrow Transplant patients and their caregivers.
2. Measurements from wearable devices on Student Wellness Group.

All the queries were made on deidentified data.
